MULTI USER MODE
===============

You can use phpMyBackupPro for several users/accounts of one database.

To do this you have to modify the global_conf_mu.php file and adapt the settings which
are described inside this file.

You will have to provide the MySQL root account data which are used by phpMyBackupPro
to determine all available MySQL users.

You can enter a path where the backups will be saved for each user and any user will
only get access to his own backup files.

The file global_conf.php will still be used to save the settings made on the
configuration page by each user. Many settings can only be modified by the MySQL root.
Just configure the global_conf_mu.php and try it out!

Further on you can use the global_conf_mu.php to activate and deactivate features like
sending backups by email, using FTP uploads or the directory backup feature.
